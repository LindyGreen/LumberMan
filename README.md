# LumberMan
Functionality cloning from lumbercraft. I was doing the architecture, not the game. Why? I was bored.
Things to make this into a functional game:
1. Change the animations of the protagonist when swiping into a spinning movement blendspace and switch between them.
2. Give enemies proper animations and decide on hit detection. A simple delay and distance check would be fine. But well. I wasn't doing this thing for that.
3. Balance the values.
4. add widgets to buildings and proper models for them.
5. add mobile input. now it's WSAD, it will be fine with an integrated joystick.
6. Give proper assets for ... everything.
7. Remove the marketplace asset folder, there are 3-4 of them used there. 
8. Make the levels properly. Not the bones I did.
9. Enemy variety. This required assets and VFX to so I skipped it. making a throw spear animation to play and spawn a projectile, and checking if hit isn't the most complex thing to do.
10. The logs. Now they are getting destroyed, but in original, they get destroyed and small ones appear you should collect.
11. Separate wood and gauntlet wood. Basically add another parameter in the player stats, when making defensive constructions in the gauntlet level. After that, it's a few branches of code.  
Developed with Unreal Engine 5
